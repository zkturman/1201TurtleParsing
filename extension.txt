Extension Overview

In this extension, I have extended for the formal grammar featured in this assignment. This new formal grammar is as follows:

   <MAIN> ::= "{" <INSTRCTLST>
   <INSTRCTLST> ::= <INSTRUCTION><INSTRCTLST> |
   "}"
   <INSTRUCTION> ::= <FD> |
                     <LT> |
                     <RT> |
                     <DO> |
                     <SET> |
                     <JUMP> |
                     <COLOUR> |
   <FD> ::= "FD" <RANDVARNUM>
   <LT> ::= "LT" <RANDVARNUM>
   <RT> ::= "RT" <RANDVARNUM>
   <DO> ::= "DO" <VAR> "FROM" <VARNUM> "TO" <VARNUM> "{" <INSTRCTLST>
   <VAR> ::= [A−Z]
   <VARNUM> ::= number | <VAR>
   <SET> ::= "SET" <VAR> ":=" <POLISH>
   <POLISH> ::= <OP> <POLISH> | <RANDVARNUM> <POLISH> | ";"
   <OP> ::= "+" | "−" | "*" | "/"
   <JUMP> ::= "JUMP" <RANDVARNUM> "," <RANDVARNUM>
   <COLOUR> ::= "COLOUR RED" | "COLOUR BLUE" | "COLOUR GREEN" | "COLOUR RANDCOL" | "COLOUR" <RANDVARNUM> <RANDVARNUM> <RANDVARNUM>
   <RANDVARNUM> ::= "RANDOM" | <VARNUM>

This new grammar features the addition three rules: <JUMP>, <COLOUR>, and <RANDVARNUM>. The rules for 
<FD>, <LT>, <RT>, and <POLISH> have also been modified to include <RANDVARNUM>. In addition to enabling
parsing for these changes, interpretation has also been added. Here is a brief summary of the effects:
	-	JUMP allows changing the current coordinates of the turtle without drawing.
	-	COLOUR allows changing the current draw colour of the turtle.
	-	RANDVARNUM includes a "RANDOM" option, which allows generating a random value instead of a preset one.
		The "Random" opiton was not added to <VARNUM> because random input for <Do> could cause unexpected behaviour.
		
As part of the extension I also explored the capabilities of the new grammar. Several examples of this can be observed in the GFX folder, 
with screenshots provided. Here I will go over some brief highlights of new features.

Alternating colours (xmascandy.ttl):
	DO A FROM 1 TO 150 {
      COLOUR RED
      FD A
      LT 31
      DO B FROM 1 TO 3 {
         COLOUR GREEN
         SET C := A 2 / ;
         FD C
         RT 30
      }
   }

Adding depth with colours (livrose.ttl):
	DO A FROM 1 TO 200 {
      SET C := A 55 + ;
      COLOUR RANDOM 0 0
      SET D := A 1.5 * ;
      FD D
      RT 62
   }

Slowly transition between colours (meander.ttl):
   DO A FROM 1 TO 255 {
      FD 10
      RT RANDOM
      COLOUR 255 A 0
   }

Create color gradients (cityscape.ttl):
   JUMP -400 , 0
   SET E := 100 ;
   COLOUR 0 0 E
   RT 90
   DO B FROM 1 TO 100 {
      FD 800
      RT 90
      FD 1
      RT 90
      FD 800
      LT 90
      FD 1
      LT 90
      SET F := B 1 * ;
      SET G := E F - ;
      COLOUR 0 0 G
   }

Moving turtle without drawing, or tail up (axes.ttl):
	COLOUR 0 0 0
    SET B := A 2 * ;
    FD B
    RT 60

Create random patterns (fracture.ttl):
    DO B FROM 1 TO 10 {
		FD RANDOM
        RT 30
    }
    JUMP 0 , 0

Create random paths (meander.ttl):
	COLOUR RED
	DO A FROM 1 TO 255 {
      FD 10
      RT RANDOM
      COLOUR 255 A 0
	}

Move turtle to specified coordinates to repeat paterns (groovacle.ttl):
	DO A FROM 1 TO 20 {
		DO B FROM 1 TO 20 {
			COLOUR 0 200 255
			FD B
			LT 30
			DO C FROM 1 TO 8 {
				COLOUR RANDCOL
				SET D := B 5 / ;
				FD D
				LT 45
			}
		}
      JUMP RANDOM , RANDOM
   }

Create randomly proportioned patterns ():

Other features include quick presets for colours that allow setting
RED, GREEN, BLUE, and RANDCOL rather than specifying RGB values. Specifically
for RANDCOL, care has been taken to incorporate only combinations of
two colours (e.g. red and green or red and blue) so that results remove
less desirable colours.
